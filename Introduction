 RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program VSD
Welcome to my GitHub Repository, this repository contains my week by week progress in this 10 week program.
In this program, we learn to design a System-on-Chip (SoC) from basic RTL to GDSII using open-source tools. Part of India’s largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, empowering 3500+ participants to build silicon and advance the nation’s semiconductor ecosystem

WEEK 0
Setup and Tools:- Installed IVerilog, Yosys, GtkWave

Key Learnings:-
Learnt basics of RTL Designs
Verified EDA Tools

Acknowledgement:-
I am thankful to Kunal Ghosh and Team VLSI System Design (VSD) for the opportunity to participate in the ongoing RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program.
I also acknowledge the support of RISC-V International, India Semiconductor Mission (ISM), VLSI Society of India (VSI), and Efabless for making this initiative possible.
